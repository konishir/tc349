By keeping their modules various shades of grey, Etsy succeeds in appearing unified. Their home button is the only object of a different color, so it stands out which is nice. The navigation of the website is straightforward and remains always in the same location no matter what page you are visiting, and their pictures are arranged in a helpful grid. Also, their search bar is front and center. There are all good for website which deals in sales to have, because ease of use is important to keep customers from becoming frustrated. Also, the better organized the website is, the more likely it is for a customer to find something they would possibly purchase. 

A few critiques would be the large gaps in the arrangement of their modules. This is just an aesthetic aspect, and perhaps more people like these gaps than dislike them. I personally just feel it makes the page appear unnecessarily spread out, and a little sloppy. But, this is better than a website that is too cluttered. Also, some of their text is a little small for my taste, for example, you would think an online-store would prefer a larger "buy" button in the upper lefthand corner, since that is kind of the point of their website.
