      United Pixelworkers follows a simple grid layout. While each item is located in it’s own box, navigation can be a bit cumbersome due to placing text for the same item in another box. For example, “This week’s featured item” is placed in a large red box, seemingly as if to entice someone to click and see the featured item. However, the featured item is already featured in an image that is three times larger than the other images on the page, directly above the new box of text. So, it is a bit redundant and a waste of page space to obviously feature an item, and then place a separate box stating the featured item is featured. However, the smaller images with text overlay stating what the item is helps tie the rest of the page together. It makes it easy to browse the product without extra hanging text boxes in the way of slick navigation.       Another problem with their page, that is also a little confusing, is that United Pixelworkers places other random tidbits of information, such as twitter or job promoting, amongst their product. It may be helpful if they used more of a division to clearly divide products verses other website information. Their grid layout works best when browsing the page dedicated solely to their product; everything fits neatly on a page, and makes it easy for the browser to see their options all in one go. This is especially important when promoting a product, since the producers would want their customers to see as much as their product as possible, and United Pixelworkers successfully manages to do this with their grid layout, despite the odd hang-up here and there.
