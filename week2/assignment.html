<h1>Critique</h1>

<p>Panic.com has a pleasant and smart layout, they make it obvious what
 they are for (apps), and make it easy to investigate and download 
 their product. Their interface is not cluttered, however, the 
 random arrow decoration near the bottom of their page did seem 
 a bit unnecessary, and seemed to mar a rather clean interface.</p>

<p>If you click on the icons, each page has a unified layout, but 
it is also customized to whichever app was selected. Overall, Panic.com 
has a memorable domain name, and comes off as very accessible. 
The website was designed to highlight their product, and make discovering 
and downloading as painless as possible, which is key to successfully marketing 
a product.</p>
