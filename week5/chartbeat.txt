      Chartbeat has a fluid layout, the colors are simple and it is pleasant to look at. The problem is that they have an overwhelming amount of content; as I scrolled through, I was really unsure of what to look at and evaluate myself. Every scroll of the page brought in even more data, and every click of a link would produce another page cluttered with more information. Part of this may be due to the fact that their product is dealing with large amounts of information, so it is unwieldy to present as neat and tidy package. 
      Their demo link in and of itself was quit impressive, it did prove that they organized large amounts of data into chunks of easily observable information; however, this again was overwhelming. Perhaps if I was dealing with a high-traffic website with large amounts of content, I would find this more useful. 
      Overall, at the present time, their website contains too much content to take in at once, and I think it would be more helpful if Chartbeat found a way to make their data more manageable, and presented it in a simpler, easier to understand display.
