      Happycog has a clean and tidy layout using bold and memorable colors. The navigation bar that stays at the top of the page is a nice touch, as it makes it really easy to get around the website. Also, it ensures their logo is always on the page. The content is organized well, into neatly spaced columns. There is even a “thank you” at the bottom of the page, which is nice and polite to all viewers of this website.       Overall, the simple interface is convenient to browse. There is nothing to distract viewers from the focus of their website. Their content is displayed in neat images with short snippets of information; this is especially helpful, because oftentimes websites try to stuff too much info onto their pages, and tend to overwhelm the people browsing their website. Happycog lists only what is necessary, and moves on to their next bit of information. This makes for a smart and pleasant website.
