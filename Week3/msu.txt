The MSU homepage is fairly cluttered; to be fair, their website does hold a lot of content. However, based objectively off appearance, and subjectively from a user who has tried to navigate this website, their home page is simply trying to contain too much. 

Upon initially arriving at the homepage, it is already crowded and overwhelming. When navigating the website, there are links within links within links. It's like inception MSU web-page style. Finding anything through the home-page is a confusing and daunting task. So, usability wise, I would not consider this website very good.

On the contrary, they do have a consistent layout. The Spartan colors of green and white are also infused throughout the website. So, graphic design is not too bad. I think overall MSU's homepage simply contains way too much content, however, the actual design of the website (navigation bar, color scheme, etc.) are not bad at all, and should speak to every Spartan's pride!
