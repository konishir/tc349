Heroku is organized in a clever and interesting way, each page appears unified due to color scheme and similar overall layout; however, when you pay attention to content, you realize that the way items are organized on the pages are different. Their “Add-ons” page is an impressive example of the gallery style layout, for example. This was a good choice, because it shows off their apps in a clean and colorful display. “Dev Center” on the other hand is a Double style layout; which is also created smartly with content in mind, because it organizes information intuitively, and also provides a side-bar navigation for ease of use. 
I will say that, while their site is appealing to look at, I’m slightly confused about what they are offering; there is just so much content, and none of it seems too related. From what I can tell, it’s a site directed towards programmers, so that itself is probably the issue. I am not part of their demographic, so I do not really need to understand their product; but for a programmer, this website would probably make much more sense.

I chose a single-style layout, because that is pretty much what I originally had going on, and it made the most sense for my content. Gallery style would have been completely bizarre for the type of content my website contains, and double style is simply unnecessary. So, I made some tweaks to my original layout by adding a heading and footer, and also trying out using percentages for margins. I wasn’t sure what else to change, so I hope I made enough changes to effectively demonstrate I was able to follow along with this week’s lesson.
