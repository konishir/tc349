My initial reaction to Vimeo is clutter; it is overwhelming to first click and be surrounded by sensory overload. There is so much text, along with the detailed image being splashed across the page, it makes one uncertain where to look. However, they make it obvious and easy how to join their site, which is smart because new users should be a top priority. Also, once you begin navigating, the layout of the site begins to sort itself out. Hovering over their navigation links bring up more options, which is helpful to the viewer of their website. Their content is then sorted categorically, you can either search by overall types of videos one is searching for or simply browse straight to common themes between the videos. It makes it easy to find content, which is good because Vimeo is a content-based website. Overall, their home page is rather cluttered, and could use some cleaning up. However, navigating the site is not bad, and considering they have so much different content, they sorted everything rather nicely for anyone browsing their website.
