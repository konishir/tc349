I decided on the text editor TextWrangler, which can be seen on the left side of my screenshot. I chose TextWrangler because it seemed pretty similar to TextMate, and it was free. I like TextWrangler because it seems really straight-forward. I guess if I wanted to, I could use KompoZer as a free alternative to Dreamweaver, but for consistency of following along with exercises, along with the fact we will not be using any of the “fancy” functions of Dreamweaver, I decided TextWrangler seemed like the best option for me.On the right side of the screenshot, you can see the browser I will be using, which is Google Chrome. I decided on Chrome because it is the browser I always use anyway, and since your own browser of choice is Chrome, it was an easy decision. This way, I know it is instructor approved, and whatever I see on my browser will be consistent with what will be seen on the other end.
