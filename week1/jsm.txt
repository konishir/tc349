	jasonsantamaria.com has a very clean interface. Everything is spaced out quite nicely; there are no large confusing gaps, but neither are objects placed too close together to be considered cluttered. It is a straightforward website; a list of articles are placed on the home page, if you click them, you follow the link. They are organized in a visually appealing way, with the title of the article placed on the left, and on the right there is either an image related to the article, or a summary of what the article is about. It is organized in a simple grid fashion, so you can easily see the content. The color scheme is also simple, primarily made up of black, white, and red, which gives the website a unified feel, without too many colors so as to become distracting.	The menu at the top of the page is also visually simple and easy to understand. Whichever page you happen to be on, the link on the menu appears darker with a red line highlighting the fact you are there. All of the other tabs are grey’d out. If you hover over them, the same darkened text effect occurs. Overall, it is a nice layout, created to be hassle-free. There are also convenient filters located on certain pages, like “Articles” and “Reading,” to help sort through all of the different links which are placed on those pages.	It is also interesting to see his section listing his old versions of the website. By clicking through these, you can slowly watch as the website becomes more user-friendly and clutter-free. The only thing I am slightly confused about is the exact point of the website; in the “About Me” section Jason calls it an experiment. So I’m assuming he’s designing the website for fun, and using it to host his portfolio, while the articles and books are just stuff he found interesting and likes to read.
