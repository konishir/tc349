			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a Media Arts student at Michigan State  University. Here are some random facts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My favorite color is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIrCizE_678">green</a>, so expect to see a lot of it once this page becomes stylized and fashionable. That being said, I'm not fashionable in the least, but I'm sure this website can make up for my lack of it, right?</li>
				<li> I like frogs!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also, here is a photo of me, so you can associate all of this content with a floating head.</p>
			<p class="pic"><img src="images/hola.jpeg" alt="it took me ages to grow this moustache" height="150"></p>
			<h2>My Interests</h2>
			<p>If you take a look around, you'll be able to find out about the types of things which keep me entertained. Namely good books, shows, and my dogs!! I'm really intense when it comes to my dogs, so don't be surprised if that page contains the most content, and the rest of this website becomes down-trodden and neglected... Just kidding! I will work very hard to keep this entire site flawless!! Be excited!</p>
