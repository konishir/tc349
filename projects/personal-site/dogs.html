			<h2>Jasmine</h2>
			<p>Jasmine is a tri-color basset hound! She's currently 7 years old, I got her as a puppy my first week of high school freshman year, now I'm a senior in college! We're both old now! She likes to make noise, and is a big talker. I have no idea what she's saying to me, but I'm sure if I could understand, it'd be really intelligent insights on the meaning of life. Jasmine's favorite things in order are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Naps</li>
				<li>Walks</li>
				<li><a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/bjsibba/IMG_4948.jpg">Sunbathing</a></li>
				<li>More Naps</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Ginger</h2>
			<p>Ginger is my spoiled little puppy. She's actually 5 years old, so not quite a puppy. A fun fact is I got both Ginger and Jasmine in a Wal-Mart parking lot! Wal-Mart's are useful sometimes, hey! Ginger is pretty funny, because she's really independent. My dad's favorite example was when he was leaving for work; he was going down the stairs, and Ginger was walking up. He apparently stopped to pat her on the head, but she ignored him and continued on her way. What a strange dog!</p>
