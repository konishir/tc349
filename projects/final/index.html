  				<p>This website was created by Rebecca Konishi as her final project for a class, TC 349. Rebecca is currently a senior at Michigan State University, majoring in Media Arts and Technology. She first became intrigued by Origami as a young child when her grandmother introduced her to the art. Her first interests in web design were piqued when she was a bit older. This site is a combination of those interests from years ago.</p>

    			<p>Origami originates from Japan; it's a traditional art-form that consists of folding pieces of paper. There are different types of origami, along with hundreds of creations one could make from a simple piece of paper. The few pieces represented on this website are barely a taste of what is possible to create. While there are only 6 creations on this site, they each dabble in different areas of Origami, from the action-oriented jumping frog, to the more complex pieces requiring a bit of assembly. Origami is truly a diverse art-form, even if it all begins the same, with a single piece of paper.</p>
