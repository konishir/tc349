The MSU Mobile site is extremely accessible for mobile devices. The initial icons are easy navigation for someone using their fingers. When reading content, it is organized in nice little snippets that are convenient for a mobile-device reader to browse.The layout conforms to the screen of the mobile device, all text re-sized so that it is easy to read from a small screen. Article headings are arranged as buttons, for better navigation from a mobile device. Overall the MSU Mobile website was designed excellently for a mobile device; it is almost better than the original website designed for larger screens.
